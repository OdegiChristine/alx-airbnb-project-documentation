# User Stories

The user stories define the core interactions between users and the Airbnb Clone backend. They describe the system from the perspective of different roles: guests, hosts, and admins,to ensure the platform meets real-world needs. These stories help guide feature implementation by focusing on user goals such as registration, property booking, payment processing, listing management, and administrative oversight.
